# Objective

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.



 

## About the Data

import pandas as pd
```
loan_data  = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/Loan_Data/loan_train.csv" )
```

## Test Dataset

Load the test data (name it as test_data). You can load the data using the below command.
```
test_data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/Loan_Data/loan_test.csv')
```
Here the target column is deliberately not there as you need to predict it.
